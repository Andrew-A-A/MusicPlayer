# SongPlayer App

SongPlayer is a music application that allows users to search for and play songs stored on their phone. This open-source project is developed using Android Studio and utilizes Java or Kotlin for the programming language, XML for the user interface, and SQL for local database management.

By building this project, you will gain valuable experience in working with background services, as the music application operates in the background alongside other apps. Additionally, you will learn how to provide notifications with play, pause, previous song, and next song buttons.

## Features

- **Song Search**: Users can search for songs present in their phone's storage.

- **Play, Pause, and Stop**: Control the playback of songs with play, pause, and stop functionality.

- **Song List**: The application fetches all songs from the phone's storage and displays them in a list format.

- **Background Service**: The music application runs as a background thread, allowing it to continue playing songs while users use other apps.

- **Notifications**: Provides notifications with play, pause, previous song, and next song buttons for convenient control.
